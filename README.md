# Python Face Detection Jupyter Notebook

Face Detection using Python Notebook,

Hi Everyone, Herewith I have updated the steps to Create Face Detection.

Step 1: Connect the Webcam into your system and Verify this is working perfectly.

Step 2: "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" copy and paste this file into your Notebook folder where you wants to run and execute the Python

Step 3: Use the "Face Detection.ipynb" file and run this. It will open the window and load the webcam. Here you can show your face, it will detect.

Note: Here we can detect multiple Faces too.

Thank you
